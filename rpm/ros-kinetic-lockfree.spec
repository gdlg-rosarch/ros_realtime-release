%description
The lockfree package contains lock-free data structures for use in multithreaded
programming. These kinds of data structures are generally not as easy to use as
single-threaded equivalents, and are not always faster. If you don't know you
need to use one, try another structure with a lock around it first.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
